The ArchPilot System

This is developed as part of Agents Intensive - Capstone Project competition.

The Problem & Central Idea
Enterprise systems suffer from Architecture Drift: high-level documentation and system diagrams fall out of sync with changing requirements and actual implementations. This leads to development tasks (Jira/tickets) that don’t match architecture, resulting in tactical patches instead of root fixes.
ArchPilot’s core idea: create an automated pipeline that turns structured requirement changes into verified architecture updates and traceable task plans.
